**matsuba** is a lightweight Japanese IME for Linux. It comes with kana input, kanji conversion and completion as well as a utility cli.

**matsuba** is still very much so a young project so bugs and issues will be present. Please do not hesitate to [leave an issue](https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/matsuba/issues).
