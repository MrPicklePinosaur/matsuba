## What is an IME?

An input method editor (IME) is a program that let's characters that
you normally cannot. **matsuba** is an IME for Japanese. **matsuba**
has two special keybindings call *henkan* (conversion mode) and
*muhenkan* (no conversion mode). In *henkan* mode, all characters that
you type will be converted into hiragana, and pressing the complete
key will bring up a list of kanji that can be converted into. In
*muhenkan* mode, your keyboard behaves like it originally does. This
let's you quickly toggle between the two keyboards.
